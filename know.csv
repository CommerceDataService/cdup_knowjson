5,earthgenome,,Environmental Data for Decision Making,Dan Hammer/Chief Data Scientist,Earth Genome,Jeff Chen,Commerce Data Service,Topography data powers smart investments in environmental and telecommunications infrastructure.,"Open environmental data can be viewed as infrastructure for society: the data is available to the public and can be meaningfully used to understand nature-based solutions to environmental issues. Earth Genome, an environmental nonprofit, has built an Green Infrastructure Support Tool (GIST) on top of open environmental data to help businesses understand investment decisions involving ""green"" infrastructure. Among the data that drives this tool is NOAA_s topography data _ a fundamental element in their wetlands restoration model for informing industrial investment decisions that support not only bottom line for manufacturing but the environment. This data is critical for everything from hydrology, risk management, construction planning, and telecommunications. In this tutorial, Earth Genome and the Commerce Data Service demonstrate how to manipulate and visualize topography data.

8,zillow,,The Hous(ing) Market Is On Fire!,Aaron Terazas,Zillow,"Star Ying, Jeff Chen ",Commerce Data Service,"When it comes to buying a house, there is a lot more to consider than just the sticker price. ","When it comes to buying a house, there is a lot more to consider than just the sticker price. Wages and salaries vary widely across the country, including within specific occupations, as does the share of household income local residents are accustomed to dedicating to housing costs each month. At one extreme, some places with low housing costs might appear to be very affordable, but incomes might also be much lower than elsewhere; at the other extreme, some places that appear to be extremely expensive when looking at prices, might be more manageable as a result of relatively high wages and salaries. By combining Zillow data on home values, rents, and historical housing-cost burdens with data on incomes by occuption from the United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we can compare housing affordability for specific types of workers in different communities across the country. In this example, we estimate the share of a household's income that goes to a monthly mortgage payment on the median home across the country's metro areas.

9,uspto,,Exploring the landscape of American Innovation,Christopher Berman,USPTO,Star Ying,Commerce Data Service,What trends are emerging in intellectual property across the US?,"Among the vast set of data that the USPTO provides, the Patent Technology Monitoring Team (PTMT) produces aggregations of the underlying patent data, along multiple, different dimensions and partitions. These aggregations answer a host of questions for us, including questions related to trends in technology and innovation in any given sector. As part of the Commerce Data Usability Project and in collaboration with the Commerce Data Service, the USPTO created a tutorial introducing Tableau as a way to explore USPTO data. In essence, Tableau makes it easy to develop visualizations in order to quickly identify the changes in data. A series of visualizations powered by Tableau and USPTO data, for example, reveals new insights into how innovation varies across the United States, state by state. In California more patents are granted for technology innovations, but in Alaska, more patents are granted for oil drilling.

10,ms powerbi 1,,Census Schooling Data with Power BI,Adam Hechtman,Microsoft,"Jeff Chen, Star Ying",Commerce Data Service,,"Data analysis using open government data has taken the center stage for everything from community organizing to starting or growing a business to crafting good public policy. Many government entities - federal, state, and local - have made open data a cornerstone of their transparency initiatives. But opening data to the public is just the first step to driving knowledge and insights in using that data. People need easy to use tools to help them discover, combine, analyze, and visualize that data. This three part tutorial will cover how to use the free version of the Power BI tool to ask questions using open federal and local data sources.

12,trees 311 p1,,Examining The Government-Constituent Relationship. With Data. And Trees,"Jonathan Auerbach, Chris Eshleman",Columbia University,Jeff Chen,Commerce Data Service,,"In 2012, Hurricane Sandy inflicted tens of billions of dollars in losses, destroying or damaging thousands of homes and vehicles and bringing the Northeast US to a grinding halt. A lesser cited impact was the storm_s toll on the city_s urban forestry. Sandy knocked down or seriously damaged over 20,000 street trees in New York City (NYC) alone. In the hours and days that followed, thousands of New Yorkers contacted local government via the City of New York_s 311 system asking for tree service to remove downed trees from cars, buildings and sidewalks. Devastating storm events are natural experiments _ i.e., well-defined, independent, observable events. Immediately following a storm, it is highly likely that tree damage reported to 311 was generated from that event. To explore this paradigm, in 2014, Jonathan Auerbach, from Columbia University_s Statistics Department, and Christopher Eshleman, recently graduated from Columbia_s School of International and Public Affairs, set out to analyze the underlying demand patterns generated by a series of storm events which recently hit New York City. They used a combination of data from the City of New York_s open data portal and the US Census Bureau, and worked closely with the City_s Parks Department and NYC311. With this data they produced a series of statistical analyses that helped to identify communities in the City that had a higher propensity to report storm damage. Through the Commerce Data Usability Project and in collaboration with the Commerce Data Service, we have presented Auerbach and Eshleman_s work as a two-part R tutorial focused on extracting insights from spatial data utilizing recent developments in Bayesian statistics. Part one focuses on the fundamentals of processing geospatial data. Part two, soon to be released, focuses on hard statistical research that enables data-driven policy and operations.","R, Rstan","NYC 311 (Pre-2010) , NYC 311 (Post-2010) , Census Tract Shapefile, NYC Parks Shapefile","This work was made possible by the collaboration and support of Deloitte Services LP, Deloitte Advisory LP, and DataWheel.",https://commercedataservice.github.io/tutorial_311_trees_p1/,"R, 311, City Data, Columbia University"
13,biz dynamics,,Tough Crowd? A Dive Into Business Dynamics,Guo Liu + Dave Goodsmith,"DataScience, Inc",Jeff Chen,Commerce Data Service,"While the startup survival has been written about, how do these survival rates shake out when we look at empirical evidence?","Every year, thousands of entrepreneurs launch startups, aiming to make it big. This journey and the perils of failure have been interrogated from many angles, from making risky decisions to start the next iconic business to the demands of having your own startup. However, while the startup survival has been written about, how do these survival rates shake out when we look at empirical evidence? As it turns out, the U.S. Census Bureau collects data on business dynamics that can be used for survival analysis of firms and jobs. In this tutorial, we build a series of functions in Python to better understand business survival across the United States. By comparing survival rates in various Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), we find regions that may fare far better in business survival than others.","Python, Plotly ",Census Business Dynamics API (http://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/business-dynamics.html),,https://commercedataservice.github.io/tutorial_biz_dynamics/,"Python, Plotly, Survival Analysis, Business Dynamics, Census Bureau, DataScience"
