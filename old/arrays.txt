How often are the vulnerabilities being discovered, exploited, or patched in the software that powers our lives? How much are we putting ourselves at risk when we ignore our updates? This tutorial uses cybersecurity data from the National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) to uncover vulnerability patterns across the tech world. ",
