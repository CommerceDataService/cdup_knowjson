","Long Description":"When it comes to buying a house, there is a lot more to consider than just the sticker price. Wages and salaries vary widely across the country, including within specific occupations, as does the share of household income local residents are accustomed to dedicating to housing costs each month. At one extreme, some places with low housing costs might appear to be very affordable, but incomes might also be much lower than elsewhere; at the other extreme, some places that appear to be extremely expensive when looking at prices, might be more manageable as a result of relatively high wages and salaries. By combining Zillow data on home values, rents, and historical housing-cost burdens with data on incomes by occuption from the United States Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we can compare housing affordability for specific types of workers in different communities across the country. In this example, we estimate the share of a household's income that goes to a monthly mortgage payment on the median home across the country's metro areas.
